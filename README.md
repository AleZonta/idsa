# Intent-Driven Scenario Authoring

This repository will hold the complete source code accompanying the paper "Integrating Run-Time Incidents in a Large-Scale Simulated Urban Environment", i.e.:
* the population and activity generator;
* the run-time incident (event) planner;
* an experimentation environment that features (2D) visualization and interaction.

## How to build
The source code is written in Java 8 and uses Apache Maven for project dependencies and settings. It can be build and run using popular Java IDEâ€™s such as Eclipse, NetBeans and IntelliJ.

## How to run
Start nl.tno.idsa.viewer.GUI (no arguments) to run the experimentation environment.

## TODO

1. Release current source code (March 2016).
